# browser-stopwatch
This is my first project using JavaScript. I decided to learn JavaScript so I could become a more well-rounded developer and add better frontends to my projects. I didn't want to get stuck in the tutorial loop. Instead, I decided to just build a simple project to refresh my very rusty HTML/CSS and start learning JavaScript along the way. There isn't much to this project, just a basic stopwatch, but this will hopefully become a stepping stone to more advanced and useful projects.
